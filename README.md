# test-typescript-for-team
A simple typescript testing project

## Main purpose

POC for team's dev on next product version

With this projet I'm intending to knockout integration and structuration 
and keeping in mind to move easily to another tech (such Angular or WebComponents)

There's still many things to setup, but it's good start :)

## How to?

if not already done, install typescrtipt and gulp
> `npm install -g typescript gulp` 

then 
> `npm install` for setting up everything
and 
> `gulp` to compile typescript and scss files 
> you can use `gulp :watch` for changing things and live recompiling 

There is no launcher, therefore you must setup your own webserver environnement.
to go fast you can use chromeserver extension

[chrome server extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb)
